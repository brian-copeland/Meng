1. Make app that ultrasonically pings every second.
	-figure out what type of sound is best
	-ivestigate to what extent it can be heard
	-determine what devices to use

2. Add in listening for pings from other devices
	-Make respond on hearing a ping to get RTT
	-calculate RTT

3. Create connection between devices
	-test to see if bluetooth, LAN, client server
	-implement on devices

4. Create model on each device of distance to other devices.
	-establish way of linking bluetooth with ultrasonic signals
	-calculate TOF between devices
	-get distance from TOF

5. Use sensors to get dead reckoning for each device as its moving.
	-determine update frequency
	-determine accuracy of dead reckoning

6. Figure out data transmission protocol to send dead reckoning to other devices
	-representation of data
	-frequency of transmission

7. Integrate other devices dead reckoning into current world model.
	-compare change of positions between two devices and change of distance

8. (Optional) Increase accuracy of current world model
	-Kalman filter?
	-Bayes updates?
	-change frequency of pinging/messaging?

9. Determine location to show on phone screen.
	-figure out which way phone is facing
	-figure out camera angle shown
	-Do something with vertical?

10. Overlay something on camera interface in location of other device.
	-figure out how to get camera interface
	-make overlay GUI on top of it.
